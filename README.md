canabalt-html5
==============
First serious game development experience for 1 month.
I inspired by and followed the [pixi scroller tutorials](http://www.yeahbutisitflash.com/?p=5226)
I tried to clone [canabalt-ios](https://github.com/ericjohnson/canabalt-ios)

## Story

It all went well for 1 month. I messed up on physics and sprite recycling. But i was passionate enough to continue.
I even added the audio, and i managed to make it look almost the same scale as the original.
Finally got stuck how scale/zoom is supposed to work. Menu text alignment was funny.
Then i decided it's not going to be prettier than this version. So i switched to Phaser.

## Play
To play run:
`grunt serve`

and open up your browser at:
`open localhost:9000`
